## Data
**[Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)**

- • Cityscapes has been widely used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating and developing computer vision algorithms related to urban scene analysis, semantic segmentation, object detection, and more. It consists of high-resolution images captured from the driver's perspective in various cities, including street scenes, buildings, pedestrians, vehicles, and other urban elements.

- • The dataset provides pixel-level annotations, such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and fine-grained object annotations, to enable detailed analysis of urban scenes.
